I am a trained Physics Laboratory Technician with a strong passion for technology, precision, and systems thinking. I am currently studying Systems Engineering at Zurich University of Applied Sciences (ZHAW) to combine my hands on laboratory experience with a solid engineering background.

My strengths lie in technical analysis, understanding complex systems, and translating theoretical knowledge into practical solutions. In addition, my experience as a strength training instructor has strengthened my communication skills, sense of responsibility, and ability to work in a structured, client focused environment.
